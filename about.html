<p>
I am an undergraduate student, science educator, and early stage researcher with a
strong interest in astronomy, astrophysics, and the physical understanding of the
Universe. Over the past several years, I have actively engaged in astronomy education,
research assistance, mentorship, and outreach, while continuously strengthening my
theoretical and analytical foundation in physics and space science.
</p>

<p>
My academic interests are centered on observational cosmology, dark matter, and the
large scale structure of the Universe. I am particularly interested in how galaxy
groups and clusters can be used as tracers of underlying dark matter halos, and how
environmental effects influence galaxy evolution.
</p>

<p>
Alongside formal education, I have pursued extensive independent learning, research
oriented projects, and teaching experiences that reflect both my curiosity about the
cosmos and my commitment to scientific growth.
</p>

<h2>Academic and Teaching Experience</h2>

<p>
I currently work as an Astronomy Tutor and Research Associate at WhyCosmos, where I
teach astronomy and astrophysics through structured courses and personalized mentorship.
My role involves simplifying complex scientific concepts, developing research based
learning material, and mentoring students for national and international competitions
and academic examinations.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I have worked as a Tutor on Schoolhouse.world, providing personalized
instruction and academic guidance to students across multiple subjects. These
experiences have strengthened my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly,
track learning progress, and foster analytical thinking.
</p>

<h2>Research and Technical Experience</h2>

<p>
I have gained hands on exposure to applied research through my internship at Omspace
Rocket Exploration Private Limited, where I supported aerospace and space technology
projects. My work included assisting in the design and study of refractor telescope
systems, liquid rocket engine concepts, and related simulations, applying principles
of optics, propulsion, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetism.
</p>

<p>
Through these experiences, I developed skills in research documentation, technical
analysis, and collaborative problem solving within multidisciplinary teams.
</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Design and development of a refractor telescope using precision optics</li>
  <li>Conceptual design and analysis of a liquid rocket engine for propulsion efficiency</li>
  <li>Antenna design applying electromagnetic theory and simulation tools</li>
  <li>Rocket nose cone design using Ansys for aerodynamic optimization</li>
  <li>Rocket structure modeling and simulation using OpenRocket</li>
  <li>Laser security system based on optics and sensor technologies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Awards and Honours</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Gold Honour, International Astronomy and Astrophysics Competition</li>
  <li>Winner, National Mapathon, IIT Bombay</li>
  <li>National Photo Contest Winner, Happy Foundation</li>
  <li>Semi Finalist, International Youth Maths Challenge</li>
</ul>

<h2>Certifications and Learning Programmes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New Space: Access to Space Basics, ISAE SUPAERO</li>
  <li>Algebra: Elementary to Advanced – Functions and Applications, Johns Hopkins University</li>
  <li>Algebra: Elementary to Advanced – Polynomials, Roots, Equations, and Inequalities, Johns Hopkins University</li>
  <li>Math Prep: College and Work Ready, University of North Texas</li>
</ul>

<h2>Leadership, Outreach, and Volunteering</h2>

<p>
I have held leadership roles in astronomy and science outreach initiatives, including
serving as President of Astronomy Conservationist Wardha and AstroClub. Through these
roles, I have organized stargazing sessions, educational events, competitions, and
community awareness programmes focused on dark sky preservation and scientific literacy.
</p>

<p>
I have also participated in community service activities, including volunteering with
ISKCON Temple initiatives focused on food and clothing distribution, strengthening my
sense of social responsibility and teamwork.
</p>

<p>
Through a combination of education, research exposure, teaching, and outreach, I am
building the skills and mindset required for research oriented environments. I aim to
pursue advanced studies in physics or astronomy and contribute meaningfully to our
understanding of the Universe.

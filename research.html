<p>
My research interests lie in observational cosmology and the study of the large scale
structure of the Universe. I am particularly interested in understanding the role of
dark matter in shaping the formation and evolution of cosmic structures.
</p>

<h2>Dark Matter and Large Scale Structure</h2>

<p>
One of my primary scientific interests is the investigation of dark matter through its
gravitational influence on galaxies, galaxy groups, and clusters. Since dark matter
does not emit light, its presence must be inferred through observations of visible
matter and the dynamics of cosmic systems.
</p>

<p>
I am especially interested in how galaxy groups and clusters trace underlying dark
matter halos, and how their properties reflect the assembly history of the Universe.
These systems provide a powerful laboratory for studying both cosmology and galaxy
evolution.
</p>

<h2>Galaxy Groups, Clusters, and Environment</h2>

<p>
Galaxy environments play a crucial role in determining how galaxies evolve over time.
Processes such as gas stripping, tidal interactions, and the influence of hot intracluster
medium can significantly alter star formation activity and galaxy morphology.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in studying how satellite galaxy properties vary across different
environments, and how observational tracers such as X-ray emission can be used to
characterize the physical conditions of galaxy groups and clusters beyond simple halo
mass estimates.
</p>

<h2>Observations, Data, and Future Directions</h2>

<p>
I am keen to develop experience working with observational datasets and simulations,
including the analysis of multi wavelength data and the application of statistical
methods to extract physical insight from large astronomical surveys.
</p>

<p>
Through research focused programmes and collaborative environments, I aim to build
a strong foundation in data analysis, critical thinking, and scientific communication,
preparing for future graduate studies in physics or astronomy.

<p>
This page highlights academic and independent projects that reflect my interest in
observational cosmology, dark matter, and large scale structure, as well as my preparation
for research focused environments.
</p>

<div class="project">
  <div class="project-title">Independent Study in Cosmology and Astrophysics</div>
  <p>
  I have undertaken independent study in cosmology and astrophysics beyond formal
  coursework, focusing on the physics of the expanding Universe, dark matter, and the
  formation of cosmic structures. This includes reading research papers, review articles,
  and standard textbooks to build a strong conceptual foundation.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="project">
  <div class="project-title">Exploring Galaxy Groups and Clusters as Tracers of Dark Matter</div>
  <p>
  As part of my academic preparation, I have explored how galaxy groups and clusters can be
  used to infer the distribution of dark matter through their observable properties. This
  includes understanding the role of environment, satellite galaxies, and the connection
  between baryonic matter and underlying dark matter halos.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="project">
  <div class="project-title">Introductory Data Analysis for Astronomy</div>
  <p>
  I am developing skills in data analysis relevant to astronomy, including basic handling
  and interpretation of datasets, visualization, and the use of computational tools to
  extract physical meaning from data. These skills form the foundation for future work with
  large astronomical surveys and simulations.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="project">
  <div class="project-title">Ongoing and Planned Research Projects</div>
  <p>
  I am actively seeking opportunities to participate in structured research projects that
  involve real observational data or simulations. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to
  studies related to galaxy environments, dark matter, and large scale structure while
  developing strong research and collaboration skills.
